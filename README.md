# wedashmo

A simple server that listens for clicks on the local network
from an Amazon Dash button and toggles the status of a WeMo
Switch/Plug.

## Prerequisites

 * [node-dash-button](https://github.com/hortinstein/node-dash-button)
   require's libpcap-dev
   * If on macOS, this should be available out of the box
   * If on linux, [install the libpcap-dev](https://github.com/hortinstein/node-dash-button#installation-instructions)
     (or similar) package with your distro's package manager. 
   * If on Windows, may god help you.
 * [ouimeaux](http://ouimeaux.rtfd.org/), a python command line tool
   * You can either install it globally with `easy_install` (see their
     documentation) or build/install it somewhere else accessible. Just
     be sure to note the full path to the `wemo` executable

## Installation

`wedashmo` can be installed globally and used as a command
line tool:

```
 $ npm install -g wedashmo
```

Or locally and used via a simple API within your node project:

```
 $ npm install --save wedashmo
```

## Setup

To use `wedashmo`, you need:
 * The MAC address of your Dash button
 * The name of your fully set up and connected WeMo Switch or Plug

 1. Find and record the MAC address of your Dash button:
    * To get this, you can use the `findbutton` 
      script that node-dash-button provides. Either run it from
      [their project](https://github.com/hortinstein/node-dash-button)
      or you can run `npm run findbutton` in the root of this project. Once
      the script is running, just press your Dash button and record the first
      MAC address that shows up with `Manufacturer: Amazon Technologies Inc.`
      following it.
 2. If you haven't yet, use the WeMo app on your phone to fully set up
    and name your WeMo Switch or Plug.
    * Record the name exactly as you entered it **or** you can use the
      `wemo list` command provided by [ouimeaux](http://ouimeaux.rtfd.org/)
      which will search for and list all the WeMo devices on your 
      network along with their exact names.

## CLI Usage
